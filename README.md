I originally wrote these websites so that myself and other people could learn italian.  It covers the material I learned in high school.  The original is still hosted on http://www.freewebs.com/the4wizkids/italian.htm.  The new version is hosted on learnnation.org/italian

My goal now is simply to

  * make the code a bit smarter
  * fix a few typos and italian grammar errors
  * store this safely on GitHub
  * See if Scopa ever worked?  If so, migrate it too

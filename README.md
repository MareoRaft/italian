I originally wrote these websites so that myself and other people could learn italian.  It covers the material I learned in high school.  The original is still hosted on http://www.freewebs.com/the4wizkids/italian.htm.  The new version is hosted on http://learnnation.org/italian/1.html.

My goal now is simply to

  * make the code a bit smarter
  * fix a few typos and italian grammar errors
  * store this safely on GitHub
  * See if Scopa ever worked?  If so, migrate it too

To generate the html and js files, run `python3 build.py`, which outputs to _build.  This is the final output that can be hosted.
